<h2>Basic personal information and self description</h2>
<p>I graduated from Ningbo City Vocational and technical college. My hobbies are watching movies and sports.In school, I like school physical education and English very much. Both courses are very interesting. Besides, mark up language document is also a good course. I learned how to make web pages in this course. I learned a lot in these classes.</p>
<p>I have a plan for everything and am good at recording. Have a sense of responsibility and have the courage to take responsibility. However, I have less work experience, my thinking is not mature enough, and the integration of theory with practice is weak. I'm not good at communication. My communication skills are average.

   </p>
<p>Although I have less work experience, I am willing to learn. I am very willing to get familiar with things I am not familiar with. In the process of work, they will actively communicate and improve their communication skills. After work, I will reflect on myself and improve my working ability. </p>
