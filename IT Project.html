  <p>My project is cloud services. Cloud service platform provides users with cloud storage and cloud computing functions. Users need to register an account to use the functions of the cloud service platform. We will not take the initiative to disclose personal information, but also strictly protect the user's personal information to prevent information leakage and safeguard the interests of users.</p>
  <h2 align="center">Values and methods</h2>
  <p>Our cloud service platform emphasizes security and timeliness. We keep users' personal information and documents stored in the cloud strictly confidential. There is no need to worry about security when using cloud service platform. And I will conduct regular security checks on the server. At the same time, the operation and maintenance audit will record the whole operation and maintenance process. Once an operation and maintenance accident occurs, it will rely on the audit records for backtracking. At the same time, my platform has efficient data transmission. When users upload, we will immediately upload it to the server for update.</p>
